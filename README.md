Keeping track of UVa problems that I solve


I will try to solve most of these using *C/C++* so, I'll be using *GNU Make* but, some problems might have solutions in Python 3 as well :smile:

## Running
### C/C++
* Compile
```bash
make
```

* Run
```bash
make run
```

* Cleanup (optional)
```bash
make clean
```

### Python
```bash
python3 main.py
```
